     <p>
      Students currently have no way to automatically input due dates and their 
      categorization (e.g. class, weight).  The only current way is to manually input 
      and sort via Exel or Google Docs, which takes hours.  If instructors used a common platform 
      (devised for this purpose) and uploaded their due dates, sorting could be done
      automatically per students unique schedule.
